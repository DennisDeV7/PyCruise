### PyCruise

*The desktop app that automates menial desktop tasks and operations.*

> What problem or pain point does it solve?  

- Automate the process of setting up your developer workflow with python automation. Simply enter a command within your terminal and your customized applications, files, and programs will open automatically. Youâ€™ll be able to go through the terminal and add, delete, or edit whatever applications you want it to automatically open upon terminal command.  

> What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?

- A custom set of terminal commands that allows the user to customize their setup. Upon one terminal command, it will open up a set of applications, files, and/or programs (dependent on user input and preference). Other terminal commands will allow the user to add opening applications and delete opening applications.  
- Stretch Goals:
    - Create docs for project/commands, 
    - Capability for different modes (i.e. **dev mode** would open up developer tools, **research mode** would open developer research tabs via google chrome)
    - User-interface application OR package-application (package seems most feasible)
    - Make it feasible for all Windows, Linux, and Mac OS
